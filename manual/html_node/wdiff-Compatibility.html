This file documents the `wdiff' command, which compares two files,
finding which words have been deleted or added to the first for getting
the second.
It also documents some other `diff' related tools.

<h3 class="section">5.2 Differences with <samp><span class="command">wdiff</span></samp></h3>

<p>Even if <samp><span class="command">mdiff</span></samp> is meant to fully support <samp><span class="command">wdiff</span></samp>, options have
been shuffled around so <samp><span class="command">mdiff</span></samp> could better merge both <samp><span class="command">diff</span></samp>
and <samp><span class="command">wdiff</span></samp> options in a common scheme.  <samp><span class="command">diff</span></samp> habits were
almost always favored in this option reorganisation.

   <p><samp><span class="command">wdiff2</span></samp> is now a mere front-end to <samp><span class="command">mdiff</span></samp> that only
rewrites the options.  The following notes apply.

     <ul>
<li>Some options are just transmitted unchanged, these are <samp><span class="option">-1</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="option">-2</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-3</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-i</span></samp>.

     <li>Option <samp><span class="option">-c</span></samp> also gets turned into <samp><span class="option">-i</span></samp>, to be compatible with
<samp><span class="command">wdiff</span></samp> versions up to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">0.4</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <li>Simple option <samp><span class="option">-a</span></samp> in <samp><span class="command">wdiff</span></samp> becomes <samp><span class="option">-A</span></samp> in <samp><span class="command">mdiff</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="option">-l</span></samp> becomes <samp><span class="option">-k</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-n</span></samp> becomes <samp><span class="option">-m</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-p</span></samp> becomes
<samp><span class="option">-o</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-s</span></samp> becomes <samp><span class="option">-v</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-t</span></samp> becomes <samp><span class="option">-z</span></samp>.

     <li>Options introducing strings, which are <samp><span class="option">-w</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-x</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-y</span></samp>
and <samp><span class="option">-z</span></samp> in <samp><span class="command">wdiff</span></samp>, respectively become <samp><span class="option">-Y</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-Z</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="option">-Q</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-R</span></samp> in <samp><span class="command">mdiff</span></samp>.

     <li>Options <samp><span class="option">-C</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-h</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-v</span></samp> are processed directly by
<samp><span class="command">wdiff</span></samp> and are not transmitted to <samp><span class="command">mdiff</span></samp>.

     <li>Further, the <samp><span class="option">-C</span></samp> option of <samp><span class="command">wdiff</span></samp> has no equivalent in
<samp><span class="command">mdiff</span></samp>.

     <li>A new option <samp><span class="option">-q</span></samp> inhibits the message which explains how <samp><span class="command">mdiff</span></samp>
might have been directly called.

     <li>The option <samp><span class="option">--diff-input</span></samp> (<samp><span class="option">-d</span></samp>) from <samp><span class="command">wdiff</span></samp>
isn't supported by <samp><span class="command">wdiff2</span></samp> (yet).

   </ul>
