This file documents the `wdiff' command, which compares two files,
finding which words have been deleted or added to the first for getting
the second.
It also documents some other `diff' related tools.

<h2 class="chapter">5 How <samp><span class="command">mdiff</span></samp> differs</h2>

<!-- ============================================================= -->
<p>The GNU project already has a <samp><span class="command">diff</span></samp> program which is part of the
GNU diffutils package.  There also are various non-GNU <samp><span class="command">diff</span></samp>
programs provided by various constructors.

   <p>There is also the well-established <samp><span class="command">wdiff</span></samp> which uses
<samp><span class="command">diff</span></samp> under the hood. It differs slightly from
<samp><span class="command">wdiff2</span></samp>, its intended <samp><span class="command">mdiff</span></samp>-based successor.

   <p>The following sections compare <samp><span class="command">mdiff</span></samp> specifications with both GNU
<samp><span class="command">diff</span></samp> and with <samp><span class="command">wdiff</span></samp>.
