This file documents the `wdiff' command, which compares two files,
finding which words have been deleted or added to the first for getting
the second.
It also documents some other `diff' related tools.

<h2 class="chapter">4 The diff format converter</h2>

<!-- ============================================================= -->
<p>The program <samp><span class="command">unify</span></samp> has the purpose of manipulating context diffs
and unified context diffs.  <samp><span class="command">unify</span></samp> will accept either a regular
context diff (old- or new-style) or a unified context diff as input,
and generate either a unified diff or a new-style context diff as output.

   <p>Various other options allow you to echo the non-diff (comment) lines to
stderr, modify the diff by removing the comment lines, and/or tweak the
diff into a format that is good for releasing patches.

   <p>I think most people prefer unified context diffs in general.  But some
of us just have trouble reading unidiffs, unless they get very simple. 
Usual context diffs show how the code was <em>before</em>, and then, how
the code is <em>after</em>.  Some people just prefer understanding twice
thoroughly, than once fuzzily.  The tool is useful for those who handle
a lot of diffs from various sources, and want them in a uniform format.
