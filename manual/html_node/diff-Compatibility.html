<h3 class="section">5.1 Differences with <code>diff</code></h3>

<p>GNU <code>diff</code> is a program which matured for a long while, and for which
algorithms are based on computer science literature.  It is a fast program.
By comparison, <code>mdiff</code> is not more than a program kludged up rapidly
to satisfy a few precise needs.  It only tries not being inordinately slow.
</p>
<p>Most <code>diff</code> options are accepted by <code>mdiff</code> under the same
short and long option names, and is able to produce resembling output,
for making <code>mdiff</code> easier to learn and less surprising to users.
Yet, some differences exist in option decoding and output format.  Since
<code>diff</code> and <code>mdiff</code> use different matching algorithms, it is
very likely that the differences will not be exactly analyzed identically.
</p>
<ul>
<li> A few <code>diff</code> options, which either accept no argument or require
a mandatory one, are implemented in <code>mdiff</code> as options accepting
an optional argument.  This may yield some surprises, for example,
<samp>-c4bir</samp> would be accepted by <code>diff</code> and rejected by
<code>mdiff</code>, yet it may rewritten <samp>-birc4</samp> for both.  See below.

</li><li> Options <samp>-c</samp> and <samp>-u</samp> in <code>diff</code> ask for regular context
and unified context output, respectively, without specifying the number
of lines in the context.  <code>diff</code> has &lsquo;<samp><span class="nolinebreak">-C</span>&nbsp;<var>number</var><!-- /@w --></samp>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<samp><span class="nolinebreak">-U</span>&nbsp;<var>number</var><!-- /@w --></samp>&rsquo; options for asking for regular or unified context
diffs with <var>number</var> context lines.  If <samp>-c4</samp> asks for four lines
of context, the &lsquo;<samp>4</samp>&rsquo; is not really an argument of <samp>-c</samp>, and this
is really interpreted as &lsquo;<samp><span class="nolinebreak">-c</span>&nbsp;<span class="nolinebreak">-4</span><!-- /@w --></samp>&rsquo;, where <samp>-<var>number</var></samp> is
meant to be a deprecated option for choosing the number of context lines,
option which <code>mdiff</code> does not implement.  In <code>mdiff</code>, <samp>-c</samp>
and <samp>-u</samp> are really two options which are allowed to receive an
optional argument, so the number of lines may, or may not be given, at
the choice of the user.  In <code>mdiff</code>, options <samp>-C</samp> and <samp>-U</samp>
are completely equivalent to <samp>-c</samp> and <samp>-u</samp>, and are provided
only for the sake of compatibility.

</li><li> Option <samp>-v</samp> in <code>diff</code> means <samp>--version</samp>, while it
means <samp>--verbose</samp> in <code>mdiff</code>.  There is no short form for
<samp>--version</samp> in <code>mdiff</code>.

</li></ul>
