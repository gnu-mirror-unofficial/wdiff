This file documents the `wdiff' command, which compares two files,
finding which words have been deleted or added to the first for getting
the second.
It also documents some other `diff' related tools.

<h3 class="section">2.1 Invoking <samp><span class="command">wdiff</span></samp></h3>

<p>The programs <samp><span class="command">wdiff</span></samp> and <samp><span class="command">wdiff2</span></samp> aim at providing the
same set of command line options. They are described below. 
See <a href="wdiff-Compatibility.html#wdiff-Compatibility">wdiff Compatibility</a>, for a list of differences.

<pre class="example">     wdiff <var>option</var> ... <var>old_file</var> <var>new_file</var>
     wdiff <var>option</var> ... -d [<var>diff_file</var>]
</pre>
   <p><samp><span class="command">wdiff</span></samp> compares files <var>old_file</var> and <var>new_file</var> and
produces an annotated copy of <var>new_file</var> on standard output.  The
empty string or the string &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo; denotes standard input, but standard
input cannot be used twice in the same invocation.  The complete path of
a file should be given, a directory name is not accepted.  <samp><span class="command">wdiff</span></samp>
will exit with a status of 0 if no differences were found, a status of 1
if any differences were found, or a status of 2 for any error.

   <p>In this documentation, <dfn>deleted text</dfn> refers to text in
<var>old_file</var> which is not in <var>new_file</var>, while <dfn>inserted text</dfn>
refers to text on <var>new_file</var> which is not in <var>old_file</var>.

   <p><samp><span class="command">wdiff</span></samp> supports the following command line options:

     <dl>
<dt><samp><span class="option">--help</span></samp><dt><samp><span class="option">-h</span></samp><dd>Print an informative help message describing the options.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">--version</span></samp><dt><samp><span class="option">-v</span></samp><dd>Print the version number of <samp><span class="command">wdiff</span></samp> on the standard error output.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">--no-deleted</span></samp><dt><samp><span class="option">-1</span></samp><dd>Avoid producing deleted words on the output.  If neither <samp><span class="option">-1</span></samp> or
<samp><span class="option">-2</span></samp> is selected, the original right margin may be exceeded for
some lines.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">--no-inserted</span></samp><dt><samp><span class="option">-2</span></samp><dd>Avoid producing inserted words on the output.  When this flag is given,
the whitespace in the output is taken from <var>old_file</var> instead of
<var>new_file</var>.  If neither <samp><span class="option">-1</span></samp> or <samp><span class="option">-2</span></samp> is selected, the
original right margin may be exceeded for some lines.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">--no-common</span></samp><dt><samp><span class="option">-3</span></samp><dd>Avoid producing common words on the output.  When this option is not
selected, common words and whitespace are taken from <var>new_file</var>,
unless option <samp><span class="option">-2</span></samp> is given, in which case common words and
whitespace are rather taken from <var>old_file</var>.  When selected,
differences are separated from one another by lines of dashes. 
Moreover, if this option is selected at the same time as <samp><span class="option">-1</span></samp> or
<samp><span class="option">-2</span></samp>, then none of the output will have any emphasis, i.e. no bold
or underlining.  Finally, if this option is not selected, but both
<samp><span class="option">-1</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-2</span></samp> are, then sections of common words between
differences are segregated by lines of dashes.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">--ignore-case</span></samp><dt><samp><span class="option">-i</span></samp><dd>Do not consider case difference while comparing words.  Each lower case
letter is seen as identical to its upper case equivalent for the purpose
of deciding if two words are the same.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">--statistics</span></samp><dt><samp><span class="option">-s</span></samp><dd>On completion, for each file, the total number of words, the number of
common words between the files, the number of words deleted or inserted
and the number of words that have changed is output.  (A changed word is
one that has been replaced or is part of a replacement.)  Except for the
total number of words, all of the numbers are followed by a percentage
relative to the total number of words in the file.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">--auto-pager</span></samp><dt><samp><span class="option">-a</span></samp><dd>Some initiatives which were previously automatically taken in previous
versions of <samp><span class="command">wdiff</span></samp> are now put under the control of this option. 
By using it, a pager is interposed whenever the <samp><span class="command">wdiff</span></samp> output is
directed to the user's terminal.  Without this option, no pager will be
called, the user is then responsible for explicitly piping <samp><span class="command">wdiff</span></samp>
output into a pager, if required.

     <p>The pager is selected by the value of the <var>PAGER</var> environment
variable when <samp><span class="command">wdiff</span></samp> is run.  If <var>PAGER</var> is not defined at
run time, then a default pager, selected at installation time, will be
used instead.  A defined but empty value of <var>PAGER</var> means no pager
at all.

     <p>When a pager is interposed through the use of this option,
one of the options <samp><span class="option">-l</span></samp> or <samp><span class="option">-t</span></samp> is also selected, depending on
whether the string &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">less</span></samp>&rsquo; appears in the pager's name or not.

     <p>It is often useful to define &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">wdiff</span></samp>&rsquo; as an alias for &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">wdiff
-a</span></samp>&rsquo;.  However, this <em>hides</em> the normal <samp><span class="command">wdiff</span></samp> behaviour.  The
default behaviour may be restored simply by piping the output from
<samp><span class="command">wdiff</span></samp> through <samp><span class="command">cat</span></samp>.  This dissociates the output from the
user's terminal.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">--printer</span></samp><dt><samp><span class="option">-p</span></samp><dd>Use over-striking to emphasize parts of the output.  Each character of the
deleted text is underlined by writing an underscore &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">_</span></samp>&rsquo; first,
then a backspace and then the letter to be underlined.  Each character of the
inserted text is emboldened by writing it twice, with a backspace in
between.  This option is not selected by default.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">--less-mode</span></samp><dt><samp><span class="option">-l</span></samp><dd>Use over-striking to emphasize parts of output.  This option works as
option <samp><span class="option">-p</span></samp>, but also over-strikes whitespace associated with
inserted text.  <samp><span class="command">less</span></samp> shows such whitespace using reverse video. 
This option is not selected by default.  However, it is automatically
turned on whenever <samp><span class="command">wdiff</span></samp> launches the pager <samp><span class="command">less</span></samp>.  See
option <samp><span class="option">-a</span></samp>.

     <p>This option is commonly used in conjunction with <samp><span class="command">less</span></samp>:

     <pre class="example">          wdiff -l <var>old_file</var> <var>new_file</var> | less
</pre>
     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">--terminal</span></samp><dt><samp><span class="option">-t</span></samp><dd>Force the production of <code>termcap</code> strings for emphasising parts of
output, even if the standard output is not associated with a terminal. 
The <samp><span class="env">TERM</span></samp> environment variable must contain the name of a valid
<code>termcap</code> entry.  If the terminal description permits, underlining
is used for marking deleted text, while bold or reverse video is used
for marking inserted text.  This option is not selected by default. 
However, it is automatically turned on whenever <samp><span class="command">wdiff</span></samp> launches a
pager, and it is known that the pager is <em>not</em> <samp><span class="command">less</span></samp>.  See
option <samp><span class="option">-a</span></samp>.

     <p>This option is commonly used when <samp><span class="command">wdiff</span></samp> output is not redirected,
but sent directly to the user terminal, as in:

     <pre class="example">          wdiff -t <var>old_file</var> <var>new_file</var>
</pre>
     <p>A common kludge uses <samp><span class="command">wdiff</span></samp> together with the pager <samp><span class="command">more</span></samp>,
as in:

     <pre class="example">          wdiff -t <var>old_file</var> <var>new_file</var> | more
</pre>
     <p>However, some versions of <samp><span class="command">more</span></samp> use <code>termcap</code> emphasis for
their own purposes, so strange interactions are possible.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">--start-delete </span><var>argument</var></samp><dt><samp><span class="option">-w </span><var>argument</var></samp><dd>Use <var>argument</var> as the <dfn>start delete</dfn> string.  This string will
be output prior to any sequence of deleted text, to mark where it
starts.  By default, no start delete string is used unless there is no
other means of distinguishing where such text starts; in this case the
default start delete string is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[-</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">--end-delete </span><var>argument</var></samp><dt><samp><span class="option">-x </span><var>argument</var></samp><dd>Use <var>argument</var> as the <dfn>end delete</dfn> string.  This string will be
output after any sequence of deleted text, to mark where it ends.  By
default, no end delete string is used unless there is no other means of
distinguishing where such text ends; in this case the default end delete
string is <samp><span class="option">-]</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">--start-insert </span><var>argument</var></samp><dt><samp><span class="option">-y </span><var>argument</var></samp><dd>Use <var>argument</var> as the <dfn>start insert</dfn> string.  This string will
be output prior to any sequence of inserted text, to mark where it
starts.  By default, no start insert string is used unless there is no
other means of distinguishing where such text starts; in this case the
default start insert string is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">{+</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">--end-insert </span><var>argument</var></samp><dt><samp><span class="option">-z </span><var>argument</var></samp><dd>Use <var>argument</var> as the <dfn>end insert</dfn> string.  This string will be
output after any sequence of inserted text, to mark where it ends.  By
default, no end insert string is used unless there is no other means of
distinguishing where such text ends; in this case the default end insert
string is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+}</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">--avoid-wraps</span></samp><dt><samp><span class="option">-n</span></samp><dd>Avoid spanning the end of line while showing deleted or inserted text. 
Any single fragment of deleted or inserted text spanning many lines will
be considered as being made up of many smaller fragments not containing
a newline.  So deleted text, for example, will have an end delete string
at the end of each line, just before the new line, and a start delete
string at the beginning of the next line.  A long paragraph of inserted
text will have each line bracketed between start insert and end insert
strings.  This behaviour is not selected by default.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">--diff-input</span></samp><dt><samp><span class="option">-d</span></samp><dd>Use single unified diff as input. If no input file is specified,
standard input is used instead. This can be used to post-process diffs
generated form other applications, like version control systems:

     <pre class="example">          svn diff | wdiff -d
</pre>
     </dl>

   <p>Note that options <samp><span class="option">-p</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-t</span></samp>, and <samp><span class="option">-[wxyz]</span></samp> are not
mutually exclusive.  If you use a combination of them, you will merely
accumulate the effect of each.  Option <samp><span class="option">-l</span></samp> is a variant of option
<samp><span class="option">-p</span></samp>.
