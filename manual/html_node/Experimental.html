This file documents the `wdiff' command, which compares two files,
finding which words have been deleted or added to the first for getting
the second.
It also documents some other `diff' related tools.

<h2 class="chapter">6 Experimental programs</h2>

<!-- ============================================================= -->
<p>The GNU wdiff source package contains sources for a number of tools
besides <samp><span class="command">wdiff</span></samp> itself. 
These are considered experimental: they might work for you, but they
might just as well fail. 
The following programs are considered experimental:

     <ul>
<li><samp><span class="command">mdiff</span></samp>
<li><samp><span class="command">wdiff2</span></samp>
<li><samp><span class="command">unify</span></samp>
</ul>

   <p>Building these applications can be configured at build time by passing
<samp><span class="option">--with-experimental</span></samp> to the <samp><span class="file">configure</span></samp> script.

   <p><em>For this build, they have been enabled.</em>
If you encounter a bug in an experimental program, the maintainers would
still like to learn about it, but there is a greater chance that they
decide not to fix such issues unless you provide a patch as well.
