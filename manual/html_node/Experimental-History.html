This file documents the `wdiff' command, which compares two files,
finding which words have been deleted or added to the first for getting
the second.
It also documents some other `diff' related tools.

<h3 class="section">6.1 History of the Experimental programs</h3>

<p>Many users
suggested features, which were in turn inviting for the integration of
<samp><span class="command">wdiff</span></samp> into GNU diffutils.  Collaboration proved to be rather
difficult.  After a few years, the <samp><span class="command">wdiff</span></samp> author finally gave in
and created <samp><span class="command">mdiff</span></samp> as a way to break out of the situation and for
becoming able to proceed with users' suggestions.

   <p>Before <samp><span class="command">mdiff</span></samp> and the new <samp><span class="command">wdiff2</span></samp> based on it were
officially released, the original author resigned maintainership. 
The new maintainers had little experience with the code, and therefore
decided to mark it experimental. That way, the code wouldn't be lost,
but it would be clear that it wasn't as testes as the good old
<code>wdiff</code> command.
