<h3 class="section">6.1 History of the Experimental programs</h3>

<p>Many users
suggested features, which were in turn inviting for the integration of
<code>wdiff</code> into GNU diffutils.  Collaboration proved to be rather
difficult.  After a few years, the <code>wdiff</code> author finally gave in
and created <code>mdiff</code> as a way to break out of the situation and for
becoming able to proceed with users&rsquo; suggestions.
</p>
<p>Before <code>mdiff</code> and the new <code>wdiff2</code> based on it were
officially released, the original author resigned maintainership.
The new maintainers had little experience with the code, and therefore
decided to mark it experimental. That way, the code wouldn&rsquo;t be lost,
but it would be clear that it wasn&rsquo;t as testes as the good old
<code>wdiff</code> command.
