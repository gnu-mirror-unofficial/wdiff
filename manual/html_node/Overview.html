This file documents the `wdiff' command, which compares two files,
finding which words have been deleted or added to the first for getting
the second.
It also documents some other `diff' related tools.

<!-- ============================================================= -->
<p><samp><span class="command">wdiff</span></samp> is a front end to <samp><span class="command">diff</span></samp> for comparing files on
a word per word basis. It works by creating two temporary files, one
word per line, and then executes <samp><span class="command">diff</span></samp> on these files. It collects the
<samp><span class="command">diff</span></samp> output and uses it to produce a nicer display of word differences
between the original files.

   <p><samp><span class="command">mdiff</span></samp> studies one or more input files altogether, and discovers
blocks of items which repeat at more than one place.  Items may be lines,
words, or units defined by user.  When in word mode, <samp><span class="command">mdiff</span></samp> compares
two files, finding which words have been deleted or added to the first
in order to create the second, which is useful when two texts differ
only by a few words and paragraphs have been refilled.  The program has
many output formats and interacts well with terminals and pagers (notably
with <samp><span class="command">less</span></samp>).

   <p><samp><span class="command">unify</span></samp> is able to convert context diffs to unidiff format, or the
other way around.  Some people just prefer one format and despise the
other, it is a religious issue.  This program brings peace back to Earth.

   <p><samp><span class="command">wdiff2</span></samp> is intended as a replacement to <samp><span class="command">wdiff</span></samp>. 
It aims at supporting the same set of options, but uses <samp><span class="command">mdiff</span></samp>
instead of <samp><span class="command">diff</span></samp> as its backend.

   <p><samp><span class="command">wdiff</span></samp>, <samp><span class="command">mdiff</span></samp> and <samp><span class="command">wdiff2</span></samp>
were written by Fran&ccedil;ois Pinard, while
<samp><span class="command">unify</span></samp> has been contributed by Wayne Davison. 
Please report bugs to <a href="mailto:wdiff-bugs@gnu.org">wdiff-bugs@gnu.org</a>. 
Include the version number, which
you can find by running the program with <samp><span class="option">--version</span></samp>.  Please include
in your message sufficient input to reproduce what you got, the output you
indeed expected, and careful explanations about the nature of the problem.
