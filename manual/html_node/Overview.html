<h2 class="chapter">1 Overview</h2>

<p><code>wdiff</code> is a front end to <code>diff</code> for comparing files on
a word per word basis. It works by creating two temporary files, one
word per line, and then executes <code>diff</code> on these files. It collects the
<code>diff</code> output and uses it to produce a nicer display of word differences
between the original files.
</p>

<p><code>mdiff</code> studies one or more input files altogether, and discovers
blocks of items which repeat at more than one place.  Items may be lines,
words, or units defined by user.  When in word mode, <code>mdiff</code> compares
two files, finding which words have been deleted or added to the first
in order to create the second, which is useful when two texts differ
only by a few words and paragraphs have been refilled.  The program has
many output formats and interacts well with terminals and pagers (notably
with <code>less</code>).
</p>
<p><code>unify</code> is able to convert context diffs to unidiff format, or the
other way around.  Some people just prefer one format and despise the
other, it is a religious issue.  This program brings peace back to Earth.
</p>
<p><code>wdiff2</code> is intended as a replacement to <code>wdiff</code>.
It aims at supporting the same set of options, but uses <code>mdiff</code>
instead of <code>diff</code> as its backend.
</p>
<p><code>wdiff</code>, <code>mdiff</code> and <code>wdiff2</code>
were written by Fran&ccedil;ois Pinard, while
<code>unify</code> has been contributed by Wayne Davison.
Please report bugs to <a href="mailto:wdiff-bugs@gnu.org">wdiff-bugs@gnu.org</a>.
Include the version number, which
you can find by running the program with <samp>--version</samp>.  Please include
in your message sufficient input to reproduce what you got, the output you
indeed expected, and careful explanations about the nature of the problem.
