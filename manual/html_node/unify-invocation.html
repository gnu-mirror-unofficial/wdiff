This file documents the `wdiff' command, which compares two files,
finding which words have been deleted or added to the first for getting
the second.
It also documents some other `diff' related tools.

<h3 class="section">4.1 Invoking <samp><span class="command">unify</span></samp></h3>

<p>The format for running the <samp><span class="command">unify</span></samp> program is:

<pre class="example">     unify <var>option</var> ... [<var>file</var>]
</pre>
   <p>The program reads the diff to convert from <var>file</var>, or if the
source file is not mentioned, it will be read from the standard input. 
The default is to output the diff in the opposite style of whatever was
input, that is, regular context diffs will become unified context diffs,
and unified context diffs will become unified context diffs, but this
can be overridden by options.

   <p><samp><span class="command">unify</span></samp> supports the following command line options:

     <dl>
<dt><samp><span class="option">--version</span></samp><dd>Merely prints the version numbers on standard output, and exits without
doing anything else.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">--help</span></samp><dd>Merely prints a page of help on standard output, and exits without doing
anything else.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">--context-diffs</span></samp><dt><samp><span class="option">-c</span></samp><dd>Forces context diff output.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">--echo-comments</span></samp><dt><samp><span class="option">-e</span></samp><dd>Echoes non-diff (comment) lines to stderr.  If a comment line is
being stripped via the <samp><span class="option">-p</span></samp> option, it is echoed with a preceding
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!!! </span></samp>&rsquo;.  If all comments are being stripped (via the <samp><span class="option">-s</span></samp>
option), no special designation is given.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">--old-diffs</span></samp><dt><samp><span class="option">-o</span></samp><dd>Is used to force a context diff to be interpreted as being of the
old-style even if it has the extra trailing asterisks that normally mark
the new-style.  This is only needed if <samp><span class="command">unify</span></samp> fails to work with
your version of <samp><span class="command">diff</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">--patch-format</span></samp><dt><samp><span class="option">-p</span></samp><dd>Turns on patch-output mode.  This will do two things:

          <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Transform a header like:

          <pre class="example">               *** orig/file	Sat May  5 02:59:37 1990
               --- ./file	Sat May  5 03:00:08 1990
</pre>
          <p class="noindent">into a line of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Index: file</span></samp>&rsquo; &mdash; we choose the shorter name and strip
a leading &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">./</span></samp>&rsquo; sequence if present.

          <li>Strip lines that begin with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Only&nbsp;in&nbsp;<!-- /@w --></span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Common&nbsp;subdir<!-- /@w --></span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Binary&nbsp;files<!-- /@w --></span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">diff&nbsp;-<!-- /@w --></span></samp>&rsquo;.

          </ol>

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">-P</span></samp><dd>Is the same as <samp><span class="option">-p</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">--strip-comments</span></samp><dt><samp><span class="option">-s</span></samp><dd>Strips non-diff lines (comments).

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">--unidiffs</span></samp><dt><samp><span class="option">-u</span></samp><dd>Forces unified diff output.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">-U</span></samp><dd>Is the same as <samp><span class="option">-up</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">--use-equals</span></samp><dt><samp><span class="option">-=</span></samp><dd>Will use a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=</span></samp>&rsquo; prefix in a unified diff for lines that are common
to both files instead of using a leading space.  Though this is harder to
read, it is less likely to be mangled by trailing-space-stripping sites
when posted to Usenet.
