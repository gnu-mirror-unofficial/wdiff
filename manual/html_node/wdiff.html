This file documents the `wdiff' command, which compares two files,
finding which words have been deleted or added to the first for getting
the second.
It also documents some other `diff' related tools.

<h2 class="chapter">2 The word difference finder</h2>

<!-- ============================================================= -->
<p>There are actually two programs for comparing files on a word per word
basis. 
<samp><span class="command">wdiff</span></samp> is a front-end to <samp><span class="command">diff</span></samp> as found in the
GNU diffutils package. It is quite mature. 
Its planned successor, <samp><span class="command">wdiff2</span></samp>, is a front end to <samp><span class="command">mdiff</span></samp>,
and as experimental as <samp><span class="command">mdiff</span></samp> itself. 
See <a href="Experimental.html#Experimental">Experimental</a>.

<p>A word is anything between whitespace.  This is useful for comparing two
texts in which a few words have been changed and for which paragraphs
have been refilled.
