<h3>Introduction to wdiff</h3>

<p>
The program wdiff is a front end to
<a href="/software/diffutils/diffutils.html">diff</a> for comparing
files on a word per word basis.  A word is anything between
whitespace.  This is useful for comparing two texts in which a few
words have been changed and for which paragraphs have been refilled.
It works by creating two temporary files, one word per line, and then
executes diff on these files.  It collects the diff output and uses it
to produce a nicer displany of word differences between the original
files.</p>
