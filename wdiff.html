<h3 id="introduction">Introduction to wdiff</h3>

<p>
The program wdiff is a front end to
<a href="/software/diffutils/diffutils.html">diff</a> for comparing
files on a word per word basis.  A word is anything between
whitespace.  This is useful for comparing two texts in which a few
words have been changed and for which paragraphs have been refilled.
It works by creating two temporary files, one word per line, and then
executes diff on these files.  It collects the diff output and uses it
to produce a nicer display of word differences between the original
files.</p>

<p>You will find a listing of release notes and other news items in
the <a href="https://savannah.gnu.org/news/?group_id=9335">Savannah
news archive</a>.</p>

<h3 id="community">Community</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/wdiff/">wdiff project page
at Savannah</a> offers many resources for people wanting to help the
project in any form. Some of these are described here as well.
The <a href="devguide.html">developer's guide</a> has a lot more details
for those wishing to contribute code or documentation.</p>

<h4 id="bugreporting">Bug reporting</h4>

<p>There are two means of dealing with bugs,
the <a href="https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?group=wdiff">Savannah
bug tracker</a> and
the <a href="http://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/wdiff-bugs">wdiff-bugs
mailing list</a>.
Before reporting a new bug, please search at least the list of open
bug reports in the bug tracker. A search through
the <a href="http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/wdiff-bugs/">mailing list
archives</a> will include bugs reported by mail or web interface,
and is therefore likely to increase the number of hits for your search.</p>

<p>If you are fairly certain that the issue hasn't been reported before,
please <a href="https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?group=wdiff&amp;func=additem">file
a bug report</a> using the Savannah bug tracker. You may also report bugs
by <a href="mailto:wdiff-bugs@gnu.org">writing to the wdiff-bugs</a> mailing
list, but reports there are harder to find and easier to forget.</p>

<h4 id="mailinglists">Mailing Lists</h4>

<p>
To subscribe to any GNU mailing list, please send an empty mail with
a Subject: header line of just "subscribe" to the relevant -request list.
For example, to subscribe yourself to the wdiff list, you would send mail to
<a href="mailto:wdiff-bugs-request@gnu.org">&lt;wdiff-bugs-request@gnu.org&gt;</a>
with no body and a Subject: header line of just "subscribe".
</p>

<p>
The mailing list for wdiff is
<a href="http://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/wdiff-bugs">&lt;wdiff-bugs@gnu.org&gt;</a>,
and is used to discuss all aspects of wdiff, including bug reports,
patches, and testing.  Announcements about wdiff and most other GNU
Software are also made on
<a href="http://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/info-gnu">&lt;info-gnu@gnu.org&gt;</a>.
